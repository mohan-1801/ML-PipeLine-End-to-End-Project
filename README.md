# Machine Learning Pipeline: End-to-End Project

This repository contains a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline implemented using Python and scikit-learn. It covers all stages of the ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment-ready packaging. The pipeline is built using synthetic data to simulate real-world applications and focuses on modular, reusable, and production-friendly code practices.
